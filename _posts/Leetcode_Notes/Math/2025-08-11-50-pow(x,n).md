## Exponentiation by squaring / Binary Exponentiation

When we want to calculate $a^n$ , if both *a* and *n* are large, multiplying $a$ for $n$ times will be inefficient.
We can use the property:
$$
a^{b+c} = a^b · a^c
$$
By expressing *n* in binary, we can split the computation into smaller powers of 2 and multiply only the necessary terms.

### Examples
1. $x^8$

   From *x*, repeatedly square itself:
   $$
   x → x^2 → x^4 → x^8
   $$
   This takes only 3 squaring operations instead of 7 multiplications.
2. $x^{15}$

   During 
   $$
   x → x^2 → x^4 → x^8
   $$

   we multiply all these intermediate powers:
   $$
   x * x^2 * x^4 * x^8 = x^{15}
   $$

### How to know which powers to multiply?
Look at the binary representation of the exponent *n*: 
$$ 13=(1101)_2$$
​
From lowest to highest bit, if a bit is 1, multiply the corresponding power of *x* into the result:

$(1101)_2$ → take $x^{2^0}$, $x^{2^2}$, $x^{2^3}$
