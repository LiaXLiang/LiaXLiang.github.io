# I. Inductive Construction
### Construction Process
- A 1-bit Gray Code has exactly two elements: ```[0, 1]```.

- Let ```G(n-1)``` be the *(n-1)*-bit Gray Code sequence of length $c' = 2^{N-1}$.
- When constructing an *n*-bit Gray Code from an *(n-1)*-bit sequence:
   - The total number of codes **doubles** from $2^{N-1}$ to $2^N$.
   
To construct ```G(n)``` from ```G(n-1)```:
1. First half:
    - Take all codes from ```G(n−1)``` and prefix a **0** to each of them.
    - This gives the first ```c'``` elements of ```G(n)``` and preserves the original order.
    - e.g.
      - From G(2) = [00, 01, 11, 10], 
      - prefixing 0 → [000, 001, 011, 010]

2. Second half:
    - Take all codes from ```G(n−1)``` **in reverse order**, and prefix a **1** to each.
    - This ensures that adjacent codes across the midpoint still differ by only one bit.
    - e.g. 
      - Reverse of G(2) = [10, 11, 01, 00]
      - Prefixing 1 → [110, 111, 101, 100]
3. Finally, concatenate the two halves:
    
    G(3) = [000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100]
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
        List<Integer> grayCode = new ArrayList<>();
        grayCode.add(0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int currentSize = grayCode.size();
            for (int j = currentSize - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                grayCode.add(grayCode.get(j) | (1 << i));
            }
        }
        return grayCode;
    }
}
```

```
Time Complexity: O(2^N)
- Iteration 0: 1 operation
- Iteration 1: 2 operations
- Iteration 2: 4 operations
- ...

- Total Operations: 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{N-1} = 2^N - 1

Space Complexity: O(2^N)
- The only data structure used is the grayCode list, which ultimately holds all 2^N elements.
- Each element is an integer, so the space used is proportional to the number of entries.

# II. General Formula
### Convert Binary Code to Gray Code


```text

Gray Code:  000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100, ...
Decimal:     0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7,  ...
Binary:     000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, ...
```

For example, we want to compute the Gray Code for decimal 5.
- Step 1: Convert the decimal to binary
  - ```5``` in binary = ```0101```
  - We label each bit of this binary number as ```b3 b2 b1 b0```, from most significant to least significant bit.
  - ```text

    b = 0   1   0   1
        b3  b2  b1  b0
    ```
- Step 2: To compute the corresponding Gray Code bits ```g3 g2 g1 g0```, we use the rule:
  - The most significant bit of the Gray Code (```g3```) is the same as the most significant bit of the binary code (```b3```).
  - Every subsequent Gray Code bit ```gᵢ``` is computed as the XOR (^) of bᵢ and bᵢ₊₁: 
  - Applying this to our example b = 0101:
    ```
    
    b = 0    1    0    1
        b3   b2   b1   b0
          \⊕/  \⊕/  \⊕/
    g = g3 g2  g1   g0
        0  1    1    1  → Gray Code = 0111
    ```

This procedure is formalized by the following bitwise expression:
Gray Code can be derived directly from binary numbers using the formula: ```Gray(i)= i ⊕ (i >> 1)``` i.e., 
```java
gray = i ^ (i >> 1);
```
### Algorithm Logic
We enumerate all n-bit binary numbers from 0 to $2^N$ - 1, and convert each of them into its corresponding Gray Code.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
        List<Integer> grayCode = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++){
            grayCode.add(i ^ (i >> 1));
        }
        return grayCode;
    }
}
```
```
Time Complexity: O(2^N)
Space Complexity: O(2^N)
```
