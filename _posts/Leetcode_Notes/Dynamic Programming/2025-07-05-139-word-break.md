e.g.
s = "catsandog"

wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
    
- **Step 1: Visualize Examples**
    - First Split Position
      - prefix "**cat**" ∈ *wordDict*
      - Check suffix "**sandog**"
        - "**sand**" ∈ *wordDict*
        - Remainder "**og**" is **not** breakable → fail
    - Second split position
      - prefix "**cats**" ∈ *wordDict*
      - Check suffix "**andog**"
        - "**and**" ∈ *wordDict*
        - Remainder "**og**" → fail
   
    In Step 1, we visualize the process as:
    - Try a *prefix* of the string.
    - If that prefix is in *wordDict*, recursively check if the *suffix* can also be segmented.

    This naturally suggests a **prefix → suffix** direction: we explore from the start of the string and work our way forward. 
    
    This recursive visualization in Step 1 represents a **top-down** process: break the string into smaller *suffixes* and recursively solve them.


- **Step 2: Find an Appropriate Subproblem**

  In contrast, dynamic programming builds solutions **bottom-up**, by solving all smaller subproblems first and combining their results to solve larger ones.

  To enable this, we need to define subproblems in such a way that:
  - Each subproblem builds upon strictly smaller *prefixes* of the input.
  - We can iteratively compute the answer from `dp[0]` up to `dp[n]`.

  We define the subproblem as:

  ```java
  dp[i] = whether s[0..i-1] can be broken into words from wordDict
  ```
  That is, we evaluate whether the *prefix* up to index *i* is breakable, which seems to reverse the direction—focusing on *prefixes*, not *suffixes*. 

  we create a structure that allows us to:
  - Start with the base case `dp[0] = true` (the empty string is trivially breakable).
  - Iterate from left to right.
  - For each *i*, check whether there exists a `j < i` such that `dp[j] == true` and `s[j..i-1] ∈ wordDict`.

  This reversal of direction isn't a contradiction—it's a deliberate transformation from a recursive formulation into an efficient iterative one. The recursive and DP solutions answer the same question, but the latter requires reframing the subproblem to enable bottom-up computation and memoization.


- **Step 3: Find Relationships Among Subproblems**

  For any position `i (1 ≤ i ≤ n)` we scan an earlier cut position `j (0 ≤ j < i)`:

  - The *left* part s[0 .. j-1] is in the dictionary
  - The *right* part s[j .. i-1] is breakable 

  If both hold for some *j*, then `dp[i] = true` otherwise it remains false.

- **Step 4: Generalize the Relationship, i.e., find the State Transition Formula**

$$dp[i] = ∨_{j=0}^{i-1} (dp[j] ∧ (s[j..i-1] ∈ wordDict))$$
  
- **Step 5: Implement by Solving Subproblems in Order**
