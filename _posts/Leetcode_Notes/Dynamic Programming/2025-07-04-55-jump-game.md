### Core Idea
If we can stand on an index *i*, we can certainly stand on every index j < i, because we reached *i* by stepping through them. Therefore, to know whether the whole game is solvable it is enough to track the furthest index we can currently reach.

### 📌 Algorithm
*Let reachable* be the largest index known to be reachable so far.

Iterate once through the array: 
 - (1) for each position *i*, verify we can actually stand on it (i ≤ reachable). If not, the game is lost.
 - (2) Otherwise ‑‑ update reachable with `i + nums[i]` if that value is larger.

The moment reachable crosses `n − 1`, the last cell is reachable and we can stop early.

This greedy invariant guarantees optimality because we always carry forward the maximum horizon achievable so far.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int reachable = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i > reachable) return false;

            reachable = Math.max(reachable, i + nums[i]);

            if (reachable >= nums.length - 1) return true;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
