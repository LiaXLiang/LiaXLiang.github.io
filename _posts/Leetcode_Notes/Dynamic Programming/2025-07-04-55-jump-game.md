### Core Idea
If we can stand on an indexÂ *i*, we can certainly stand on every indexÂ j < i, because we reachedÂ *i* by stepping through them. Therefore, to know whether the whole game is solvable it is enough to track the furthest index we can currently reach.

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm
*LetÂ reachable* be the largest index known to be reachable so far.

Iterate once through the array: 
 - (1) for each position *i*, verify we can actually stand on it (i â‰¤ reachable). If not, the game is lost.
 - (2) Otherwise: update reachable with `i + nums[i]` if that value is larger.

The moment reachable crosses `nÂ âˆ’Â 1`, the last cell is reachable and we can stop early.

This greedy invariant guarantees optimality because we always carry forward the maximum horizon achievable so far.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int reachable = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i > reachable) return false;

            reachable = Math.max(reachable, i + nums[i]);

            if (reachable >= nums.length - 1) return true;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

```
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```

### Implementation Notes
#### Do we need dynamic programming?
No. Because jumps are only forward and each position carries a single parameter (`nums[i]`), a greedy scan suffices.

#### Zero values are harmless if preceded by sufficient reach.
A *0* merely means we cannot jump from that index. As long as *reachable* already leaps over it, the path remains open.
