# I. Bitmask Enumeration
### Core Idea
For a set of *n* elements, each element has two choices: either be **included in** or **excluded from** a subset. Therefore, there are exactly 2^n possible subsets. 

We can represent each subset using a bitmask: a binary number of length *n* where each bit indicates whether the corresponding element is included (1) or not (0).
- e.g. 
    ```java 
    nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    ```
    A possible subset {2, 4, 7} can be encoded as:
    ```
    nums =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    mask =   0  1  0  1  0  0  1 
    â†’ binary: 0101001
    ```
    Each *1* in the mask represents the inclusion of the corresponding element in the subset.

### Algorithm Logic
We reverse the above perspective: instead of choosing elements to build a subset, we iterate through all integers from 0 to 2^n - 1, treating each integer as a bitmask.

For each bit *j* in the binary representation of the current integer *i*, if the *j*-th bit is 1, we include ```nums[j]``` in the current subset. For example, if the bit at position *1* (counting from the right, 0-indexed) is 1, it corresponds to ```nums[1]```, which is 2.

This approach allows us to systematically and efficiently enumerate all possible subsets without recursion, using simple bitwise operations.

### Implementation Note
Quick Recap of Bitwise Operations
- ```(i >> j)```
  - Performs a right bit shift, moving the binary representation of integer *i* to the right by *j* positions.
  - Equivalent to: ```i >> j â‰ˆ floor(i / 2^j)```
  - e.g.
    ```java
    int i = 6;       // binary: 110
    int j = 1;
    int result = i >> j;  // 110 >> 1 = 011 = 3
    ``` 
- ```(i >> j) & 1```
  - Checks whether the *j*-th bit (from the right, 0-indexed) of integer *i* equals 1.
    - ```i >> j```: shifts the target bit to the least significant position.
    - ```& 1```: masks all other bits, leaving only the last bit (0 or 1).
    - e.g.
    ```java
    int i = 6; // binary: 110
    (i >> 1) = 011 â†’ & 1 = 1   â†’ Bit at position 1 is 1
    (i >> 2) = 001 â†’ & 1 = 1   â†’ Bit at position 2 is 1
    (i >> 0) = 110 â†’ & 1 = 0   â†’ Bit at position 0 is 0
    ```
- ```1 << n```
  -  Performs  a left bit shift, moving the binary representation of *1* to the left by *n* positions. It computes the value of 2 to the power of n. Mathematically, 1 << n is equivalent to 2^n.
  - e.g.
    ```java
    1 << 3 
    â†’ binary: 1000 â†’ decimal: 8 (which is 2^3)
    ```

### Solution 
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();

        // Iterate through all bitmasks from 0 to 2^n - 1
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>();

            // For each bit position j, check if the j-th bit is set to 1
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (((mask >> j) & 1) == 1) {
                    subset.add(nums[j]);
                }
            }

            res.add(subset);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

```
Time Complexity: O(NÂ·2^N)
    - The outer loop runs from 0 to 2^n - 1, so it executes 2^n times.
    - Inside the loop, for each bitmask of length n, we check all n bits (from 0 to n - 1).
Space Complexity: O(NÂ·2^N)
    - The result list stores all 2^N subsets.
    - Each subset can contain up to N elements.
```

# II. BFS List-Based Approach
### Core Idea
We can draw a parallel between Leetcode 78 â€“ Subsets and [Leetcode 17 â€“ Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://liaxliang.github.io/17-letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/), where both problems can be approached as a form of Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal.

In both problems, the idea is to **incrementally build combinations or subsets** as new elements (either digits or numbers) are processed. The underlying mechanics are similar â€” we start with an initial state and expand the result level by level.
- e.g. nums = [7, 8, 9]
    ```
    Step 0: Initialization: 
            Start with the empty subset: 
        List: [ [] ]

    Step 1: (i = 0) Process number 7
            Add '7' to each existing subset (currently only [])
        Updated List: [ [], [7] ]

    Step 2: (i = 1) Process number 8
            Add '8' to each existing subset: [], [7]
            - Add 8 to []  â†’ [8]
            - Add 8 to [7] â†’ [7, 8]

        Updated List: [ [], [7], [8], [7,8] ]

    Step 3: (i = 2) Process number 9
            Add '8' to each existing subset: [], [7], [8], [7,8]
            - Add 9 to []    â†’ [9]
            - Add 9 to [7]   â†’ [7, 9]
            - Add 9 to [8]   â†’ [8, 9]
            - Add 9 to [7,8] â†’ [7, 8, 9]
        
        Final List: [ [], [7], [8], [7,8], [9], [7, 9], [8, 9], [7, 8 , 9] ]
    ```
 
 ### Implementation Note

 In [Leetcode 17](https://liaxliang.github.io/17-letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/), we used a ***queue*** to perform a BFS traversal. Each level corresponds to adding one digit to existing combinations. Importantly:
  - **Intermediate combinations are temporary** â€” we dequeue them, extend them with the current digit, and then enqueue the new combinations.
  - Only the final combinations are retained.

In contrast, for Leetcode 78, we must **retain all intermediate results** because every subset generated during the process is part of the final answer. Therefore:
  - We do not use a queue or perform dequeue operations.
  - Instead, we use a ```List<List<Integer>>``` that we iterate and expand, appending new subsets at each step.

### ðŸ“Œ Algorithm
- (1) Initialize the result list:
  - Start with a list containining the empty subset [ [] ].
- (2) Iterate through each number *num* in *nums*:
  - For each existing subset in the list, create a new subset by adding *num* .
  - Add all these new subsets into the result list.

### Solution
```java
class Solution{
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        res.add(new ArrayList<>()); // Start with the empty subset

        for (int num : nums) {
            int size = res.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>(res.get(i));
                subset.add(num);
                res.add(subset);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
```
Time Complexity: O(NÂ·2^N)
For each number, we copy each subset of size up to n costs O(2^N) and add an element in O(N)

Space Complexity: O(NÂ·2^N)
We are storing 2^N subsets. Each subset is an ArrayList<Integer> of size up to N.

# III. DFS Recursive Backtracking
### Core Idea
We can model the solution as a **decision tree** traversal:
- Each **level** represents processing the *i*-th element in the array.
- Each **node** corresponds to a valid subset (the current decision path).
- Each **branch** represents a decision to include an element.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(new ArrayList<>(), nums, 0, res);
        return res;
    }

    public void backtrack(List<Integer> currentPath, int[] nums, int start, List<List<Integer>> res) {
        // Every path is a valid subset
        res.add(new ArrayList<>(currentPath)); 

        for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) { 
            currentPath.add(nums[i]);                   // Make a decision
            backtrack(currentPath, nums, i + 1, res);   // Explore next level
            currentPath.remove(currentPath.size() - 1); // Backtrack
        }
    }
}

```
