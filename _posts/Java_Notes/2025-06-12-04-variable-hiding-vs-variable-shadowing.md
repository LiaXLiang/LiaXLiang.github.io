### Variables Are Everywhere

In almost every programming language, variables serve as the basic units to solve problems. 

A variable is not just a name.

Take this simple line of code:
```java
int score = 100;
```
Here, `score` is a variable â€” but Java doesn't just see a name and a value. It also sees a <font color = red>type</font>.
